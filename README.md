# TYPING-SPEED-TEST

THIS IS MY FIRST JAVASCRIPT PROJECT.

First of all , Thanks for choosing this website for testing your Typing Speed.

DISCLAIMER : This is a static site, for learning purpose, so the results may vary from other speed testers.

 Here You are Required to Enter Your Name And Chosse The Difficulty Level. Upon Choosen Difficulty , You will have to type the Given sentence, Your speed will be calculated as wpm(words per minute).
 
  Penalty : For each incorrect/missed word 0.5 sec will be added to your timer. This text evaluation is Case sensetive


## Lessons Learned

I have learned a gist of Javascript from this project , which are very much helpful for my other advanced projects of Developments.

Problems Faced  : I intended to make this a single page WebApp so that the user connectivity may not be a problem during the test. I overcame this by just a simple solution of making multiple containers and displaying them accouding to the progress of the game.
